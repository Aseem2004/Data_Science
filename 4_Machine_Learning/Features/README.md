<h2><b>Features</b></h2>
Features are the measurable properties or characteristics of the data that are used as input to a machine learning model. They represent the information or attributes 
that a model uses to make predictions or classifications. Features play a crucial role in determining the performance and accuracy of the model.<br><br>

Features are the input variables (independent variables) that a machine learning model analyzes.<br>
Example: In predicting house prices, features might include square footage, number of bedrooms, and location.<br><br>

Types of Features:<br>
<ul>
<li>Numerical Features: Quantitative values (e.g., age, salary).</li>
<li>Categorical Features: Qualitative values (e.g., gender, product type).</li>
<li>Ordinal Features: Categorical features with an inherent order (e.g., rating: low, medium, high).</li>
<li>Boolean Features: Binary values (e.g., true/false, 1/0).</li>
</ul><br>

Examples of features in a dataset:<br>

In a dataset, the number of features refers to the input variables used to predict the target variable.<br>
If your dataset has 3 columns:<br>
1) Two columns are input variables (used to predict)<br>
2) One column is the output variable (target variable, dependent variable, or label)
