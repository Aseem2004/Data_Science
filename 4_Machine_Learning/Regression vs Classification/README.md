Regression and Classification are two primary tasks in supervised learning. The distinction lies in the type of output they predict and the nature of the problems 
they address.<br><br>

<h2><b>Regression</b></h2>
Regression models predict a continuous numerical value as output. They determine a relationship between input variables (features) and a continuous target variable.<br>
Use Cases: Predicting house prices, Estimating stock prices, Forecasting weather conditions.<br><br>
Key Algorithms:
<ul>
<li>Linear Regression</li>
<li>Polynomial Regression</li>
<li>Support Vector Regression (SVR)</li>
<li>Decision Trees</li>
<li>Random Forest for Regression</li>
</ul><br>

<h2><b>Classification</b></h2>
Classification models predict discrete labels or categories as output.They assign data points to predefined classes based on the input features.<br>
Use Cases: Email spam detection (Spam or Not Spam), Disease diagnosis (Positive or Negative), Image classification (e.g., Cat, Dog, or Bird).<br><br>
Key Algorithms:
<ul>
<li>Logistic Regression</li>
<li>Support Vector Classifier (SVC)</li>
<li>K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN)</li>
<li>Decision Trees</li>
<li>Random Forest for Classification</li>
<li>Naive Bayes</li>
<ul><br>

Examples of Algorithms Used in Both Tasks: Some algorithms can be adapted for both regression and classification depending on the data and implementation:<br>
<ol type='1'>
<li>Decision Trees:
  <ul>
<li>Regression: Output is a numerical value (e.g., predicted price).</li>
<li>Classification: Output is a class (e.g., spam or not spam).</li></li>
  </ul><br>
<li>Support Vector Machines (SVM):
  <ul>
<li>Regression: Known as SVR (Support Vector Regression).</li>
<li>Classification: Maps data to categories.</li></li>
  </ul>
</ol>
