<h2><b>Scikit Learn:</b></h2><br>
<p>Scikit-learn is an open-source machine learning library for Python that provides simple and efficient tools for data analysis and machine learning. It is built on 
top of foundational Python libraries like NumPy, SciPy, and matplotlib, making it a versatile choice for a wide range of machine learning tasks.<br>
Scikit-learn's simplicity, versatility, and efficiency make it a staple in Python's ML ecosystem. It is the go-to choice for classical ML tasks, thanks to its 
consistent API, rich functionality, and ease of integration with other Python libraries. </p>

<p>
  Here we will just see the overview of basics as the ML models utilising Sklearn are used in detail in other modules of the same folder in same repository.<br>
  <ul>
    <li><b>sklearn.datasets.make_blobs:</b> It is a function in the scikit-learn library used to generate synthetic datasets for clustering and classification tasks.</li><br>
    <li><b>sklearn.model_selection.train_test_split:</b> It is used in Scikit-learn to split data into training and testing subsets. It is a critical step in 
      supervised machine learning workflows to evaluate model performance on unseen data.</li><br>
  </ul>
