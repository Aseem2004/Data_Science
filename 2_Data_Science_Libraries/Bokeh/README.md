When using Bokeh in Google Colab, we can visualize the plots directly within the notebook because of the output_notebook() function.<br>
However, in GitHub, the interactive Bokeh plots might not render there because GitHub doesn't support rendering dynamic or interactive HTML/Javascript content like Bokeh plots.<br>
GitHub only displays static outputs like images or text. Bokeh generates interactive plots using JavaScript, which doesn't render on GitHub as it doesn't execute scripts embedded in the notebook.<br><br>
I am attaching pictures of outputs that were rendered in notebook.
