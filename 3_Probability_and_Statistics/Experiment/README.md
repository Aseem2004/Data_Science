  <li><b>Experiment: </b>An experiment in probability is any action or process that produces observable outcomes.<br>
  Ex: Measuring the height of a plant each day as it grows. Here, you expect a predictable outcome (gradual increase in height) and aren’t necessarily dealing with randomness.</li><br>

  <li><b>Random Experiment/Trial: </b>A random experiment, however, specifically refers to an experiment with an uncertain outcome that cannot be precisely predicted in advance. Each outcome of a random experiment is determined by chance.<br>
  Ex: Rolling a six-sided die. The outcome (a number between 1 and 6) is uncertain and determined by chance each time you roll, making this a random experiment.<br>
  Ex: Tossing a fair coin</li><br>

  <li><b>Outcome: </b>An outcome is a single, possible result of a random trial. It’s the specific result that occurs when an experiment is performed.<br>
  Ex: If you roll a six-sided die, a possible outcome can be getting a 3.<br>
  Ex: Tossing a coin and getting Heads.</li><br>

  <li><b>Sample Space: </b>A sample space is the set of all possible outcomes of an experiment. It represents every potential result that can occur when the experiment is conducted.<br>
  Ex: For a single coin toss, the sample space is {Heads, Tails}.<br>
  Ex: For rolling a six-sided die, the sample space is {1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6}.<br>
  --> It can be uncountable as well. Ex: Tossing a coin until a head appears: {H, TH, TTH, TTTH, .......} </li><br>

  <li><b>Event: </b>Every subset of sample space is an event including full sample space and null set. Or, we can say that every element of power set of sample space is an event.<br>
  Ex: If we roll a six-sided die, the event of rolling a 4 is a simple event. It can be represented as: E={4}</li><br>

  <li><b>Mutually Exclusive Events: </b>Mutually Exclusive Events are events that cannot occur at the same time. In other words, if one event happens, the other event cannot happen. When two events are mutually exclusive, the occurrence of one event excludes the possibility of the other event occurring.<br>
  Ex: When you toss a coin, the events of getting "Heads" (H) and "Tails" (T) are mutually exclusive. If the coin lands on heads, it cannot land on tails at the same time.<br>
  Events: E1={H}, E2={T}, such that E1∩E2=Φ.</li>
</ul>
