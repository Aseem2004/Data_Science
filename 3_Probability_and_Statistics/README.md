<b>Probability:</b> Probability, as a theory deals with predicting the confidence or likelihood for future events, something that is going to happen, how likely it is going to happen and probability as a 
number is basically between zero and one. It determines confidence value for future events.<br>
In short, probability is about predicting the likelihood of future events.<br>
For example, when you flip a coin, the probability of getting heads is 50% (or 0.5), because there are two equally likely outcomes (heads or tails).

<b>Statistics:</b> It is the branch of mathematics that deals with the collection, analysis, interpretation, presentation, and organization of data. It helps us make sense of large amounts of information and draw 
meaningful conclusions from it.<br>
In short, statistics is about using data from the past to make conclusions or decisions.<br>
For example, if you flip a coin 100 times and get 60 heads, statistics helps you analyze that result and understand what it means (maybe your coin is biased?).
