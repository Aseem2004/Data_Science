  <li><b>Probability: </b>Probability is the measure of how likely an event is to happen, expressed as a number between 0 and 1, where 0 means impossible and 1 means certain.</li><br>

  <li><b>Probability Law: </b>A probability law, or probability axiom, defines the rules that a probability function must follow when assigning probabilities to events, i.e. it goes from an event to a number.</li><br>

  <li><b>Axioms of probability: </b>
    <ol type='1'>
      <li><b>Non-negativity: </b>The probability of any event A must be a non-negative number: P(A)≥0</li> 
      <li><b>Normalization:</b> The probability of the entire sample space S is 1, meaning that something in the sample space is certain to happen: P(S)=1</li>
      <li><b>Additivity:</b> If A and B are mutually exclusive events, the probability of either A or B occurring is the sum of their individual probabilities: P(A∪B)=P(A)+P(B)</li>
