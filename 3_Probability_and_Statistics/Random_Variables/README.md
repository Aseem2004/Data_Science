  <li><b>Random Variable:</b> A random variable in statistics is a numerical value that represents the outcomes of a random phenomenon or experiment. 
    It is called "random" because the specific value it takes depends on the outcome of an event.<br>
    For example:<br>
    If you toss a coin, you can assign 1 for Heads and 0 for Tails.<br>
    If you roll a die, you can use the number that appears on the die as the random variable.</li><br>

  <li><b>Types of random variables:</b><br>
    <ol type=1>
  <li>Discrete Random Variable: Takes on countable values, such as whole numbers.<br>
  Example: The number of heads in 5 coin tosses (X=0,1,2,3,4,5).<br></li>
    
  <li>Continuous Random Variable: Takes on any value within a range or interval, typically measured quantities.<br>
  Example: The time it takes for a train to arrive (X∈[0,∞)).</li>
  </ol>
  </li>

  <b><h2>Note:</h2></b> If probability of a random variable is 0, it always mean it represents an empty set or an impossible event in case of discrete random variable but doesn't in case of continuous random variable.<br>

 <li><b>Probability Mass Function (PMF)</b> It is a function that gives the probability of a discrete random variable taking on specific values. It maps each possible value of the random variable to its probability, ensuring the following properties:<br>
1) Non-negativity: P(X=x)≥0 for all x.<br>
2) Sum of probabilities equals 1: ∑ (x∈S) P(X=x)=1, where S is the set of all possible values the random variable can take.</li>
