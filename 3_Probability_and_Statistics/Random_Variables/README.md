  <li><b>Random Variable:</b> A random variable in statistics is a numerical value that represents the outcomes of a random phenomenon or experiment. 
    It is called "random" because the specific value it takes depends on the outcome of an event.<br>
    For example:<br>
    If you toss a coin, you can assign 1 for Heads and 0 for Tails.<br>
    If you roll a die, you can use the number that appears on the die as the random variable.</li>
